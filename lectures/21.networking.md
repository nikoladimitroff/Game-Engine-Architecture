## Review

What are bounding volumes / collision primitives?

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

Describe the basic algorithm / equations
for computing the position of an object out of forces.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Extended review

Why is `TIME_STEP` a constant?

```cpp
void PhysicsEngine::Step()
{
    const float TIME_STEP = 1 / 60.f;
    ApplyForces();
    SolveDynamics();
    SolveConstraints();
}
```

## Networking

- http://gafferongames.com/networking-for-game-programmers/

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- latency - has a huge impact on the gameplay
- traffic - costs you money
- throughput

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Low level networking

The [BSD sockets API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets) is used
almost on any platform
- some platforms have BSD sockets with some specifics


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- `socket()` creates a new socket of a certain socket type, identified by an
  integer number, and allocates system resources to it.
- `close()` causes the system to release resources allocated to a socket. In case
  of TCP, the connection is terminated.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- `bind()` is typically used on the server side, and associates a socket with a
  socket address structure, i.e. a specified local port number and IP address.
- `listen()` is used on the server side, and causes a bound TCP socket to enter
  listening state.
- `accept()` is used on the server side. It accepts a received incoming attempt to
  create a new TCP connection from the remote client, and creates a new socket
  associated with the socket address pair of this connection.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- `connect()` is used on the client side, and assigns a free local port number to
  a socket. In case of a TCP socket, it causes an attempt to establish a new TCP
  connection.


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- `send()` and `recv()`, or `write()` and `read()`, or `sendto()` and `recvfrom()`, are used
  for sending and receiving data to/from a remote socket.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- `gethostbyname()` and `gethostbyaddr()` are used to resolve host names and
  addresses. IPv4 only.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- `select()` is used to pend, waiting for one or more of a provided list of
  sockets to be ready to read, ready to write, or that have errors.
- `poll()` is used to check on the state of a socket in a set of sockets. The set
  can be tested to see if any socket can be written to, read from or if an error
  occurred.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- `getsockopt()` is used to retrieve the current value of a particular socket
  option for the specified socket.
- `setsockopt()` is used to set a particular socket option for the specified
  socket.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Platform specific APIs provide more control and features.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## TCP vs UDP

- Transmission Control Protocol
  - reliable
  - in-order
- User Datagram Protocol
  - unreliable
  - out-of-order
  - may receive packets multiple times


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### TCP

- there is a connection
  - handshake
- checksums
- windows


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

![Connection](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/InternetSocketBasicDiagram_zhtw.png)


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- having an connection, means that the server needs a port for each client
  - 60K clients per server
  - IPv6 - Are we there yet?
- each packet is acknowledged
  - more traffic
  - lower thoughput

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Pros:

- faster
- more efficent
- more control

#### Cons:

- requires some code

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### HTTP

- generally non-critical game code uses HTTP/TCP
  - TCP traffic can increase UDP loss rate

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Peer-to-peer networking

Providing better service for lower costs

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- great for voice streaming in game
- great for installs and updates
- "LAN" party

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### STUN

- because everybody has a router
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Tools

- https://github.com/OculusVR/RakNet
- WireShark

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## High level networking


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Data Serialization

Reading and writing C++ objects through the network

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCsEHYwjqVE

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Has to be automatically:

- it is error-prone
- it is boring

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- reflection
- C++ meta programming
- protobuf, thrift, msgpack, flatbuffers

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Schema Upgrade

The ability to read older version of the data

- old clients talking to new server

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Remote Procedure Call

1. Each side has a `map<MessageId, Handler>`
2. Caller sends the message id and serialized arguments
3. Receivers deserializes the arguments, and calls the handler

- different versions of the protocol?

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Data Synchronization

Synchronize set of objects between the clients and the server.

- Most of the data of an object is constant
  - no need to send the player's name, when only his health has changed

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Each frame, for each synchronized object

1. Gather the set of changed properties and serialize
them.
2. Send the *[{field_id, new_value}, ...]* collection.

When the receiver gets the values, deserialzies them, assigns the new values to
the fields and triggers any *on-change* handlers.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Each object MUST have a single authority for its value


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Collections

The player gets a new item, the entire inventory is dirty-flagged and sent over
the network.

Observable collections
- `ItemAdded(index, value)`
- `ItemRemoved(index)`
- `ItemChanged(index, value)`

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Referring to objects

- GUIDS - 16 Bytes might be too mach
  - memory
  - comparison!

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Consequitive generated 8 byte numbers

- 2^64 / (1000 * 3600 * 24 * 365) ~= 584942417
- have a global authority and give ranges of ids to each client

--- NEXT SLIDE ---
## Gameplay impact of networking

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---
### Strategies for multiplayer

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---
#### Strategy games

- Synchronize the simulation and send only the players' actions
  - synchronize the random generator
- The simulation runs on fixed frame, waiting of the actions of each player
  - one stops and everybody waits for them

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---
#### FPS games

- The server computes the positions of the players in the time of each shot and
  decides whether there is a hit or no

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---
#### Motion prediction

Make the actors move reallistically when have only snapshots of their state
(and the snapshots are from the past)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Extrapolate the speed, direction and position of the object, based on the last
  few snapshots
- When receiving new snapshots, update the values smoothly, unless the error is
  above some threshold - then just teleport the player


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

For FPS games the motion data is number one priority - send as often as
possible, so it has significant impact on the traffic generated.

- You can send only delta from the previous frame and each N frames - send the
  complete data - word transformation, speed, acceleration, angular
  velocity, momentum

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Why send the complete data?

- because UDP can drop packets
- acknowledging and resending the packets with delta only can be skipped

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

You can send the delta using 16-bit floating point numbers

- when the changes are small, half precision will be fine


--- NEXT SLIDE ---

Questions?
