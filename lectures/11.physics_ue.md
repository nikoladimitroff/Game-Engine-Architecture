# Sanity check

We are recording, aren't we?

## Review

What extension does Unreal use to store resources?

* .uasset
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

What class do you need to inherit in order to implement custom settings?

* UDeveloperSettings
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

What do you need in order to set a timer?

* Timer Manager
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* Timer Handle
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* Object to call the timer function on.
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* Method to call when timer fires.
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* Time between set and firing
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* Is it looping
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* The time for the first iteration of a looping timer
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

## Physics sim

* Unreal used to work with PhysX before 5.0
* Now uses Chaos Physics (developed internally)
* Chaos Flesh
* Chaos Destruction
* Cloth Simulation
* Fluid Simulation

## Simple vs Complex Collision

* Simple Collision - boxes, spheres, capsules and convex hulls
* Complex Collision - mesh

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Collision responses

* Block 
* Overlap 
* Ignore

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Collision responses

* For two or more simulating objects to block each other, they both need to be set to block their respective object types 
* if one is set to overlap an object, and the second object is set to block the other, the overlap will occur, but not the block

## Useful console commands

* show COLLISION - draws all collision models
* stat game - usefull stats for collisions

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Traces

* Trace by Channel
* Trace by Object Type

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Shape Traces

* Box Trace
* Capsule Trace
* Sphere Trace

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## UV Coordinates from Trace

* Project Settings -> Physics -> Support UV From Hit Results
* Useful for doing fancy calculations like playing different sounds depending on whether a bullet hit a bulletproof vest or flesh
* Increased CPU memory usage - the engine needs to keep addional copy for vertex positions and UV coordinates in main memory

## Physics materials

* Friction 
* Restitution (Bounciness)
* Density (g/cm^3)

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Physics constraints

* Used to connect two rigid body simulated objects together
* As actor or as component
* Default Joints - Hinges, prismatics, ball-and-socket
* Physics Damping - Simulate Drag

## Fixed vs variable frame rate

* Fixed frame rate is easier to implement and easier to predict
* Variable frame rate is good for hardware scalability
* Unreal Engine uses variable frame rate by default

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Physics substepping

* When a single update is not enough
* Project Settings -> Physics
