# What's this course about?

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Game development

* What is a game?
* How does a game team look like?
* How does a commercially-successful game engine look like?
* Is Unreal Engine 4 *awesome*? (hint: yes, yes it is)
* How do you write code for games?

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

# Who should visit the course?

Programmers.
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* We'll focus on programming
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> We'll only spend some itty-bitty time discussing game design and content creation (they deserve a course of their own!)
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> But you'll get to see how awesome UE4 is
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" --> We'll make it hard to you

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Required knowledge

* OOP with C++
  - We'll review and extend some C++ concepts
* Data structures
* First-year math - analytical geometry, linear algebra, basic calculus

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## What to expect

* Getting the knowledge required to start a job
* Access to the ~~Sofia's~~ global game dev industry
* Some out-of-class surprises
* 3 guys trying to be funny but failing at it

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

# Why do we do it?

* We like torturing people
* We'd love to see more game developers
* We think you might like it

* ...incredibly rewarding
* ...an art form
* ...a great job to have
  * ...most of the time <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

# A game dev team

* Developers<sup>1</sup>
  - Game
  - Engine
  - Tools
* Designers (Game designers, level designers)
* Artists (Concept Artists, Modelers, Animators, Writers, Composers, Actors)
* Producers

<sup>1</sup> Can be further specialized into subsystems.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

# How is a game created?

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Three phases:

* Pre-production
* Production
* Post-production

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Pre-production

* Idea - 'I wanna make a game MMO-fighter game!'
* Pitch - 'I can make this game make money because...'
* Concept & prototypes
  * 'This game will have...and the player will...and players will like it because...'
  * The birth of a game design document
  * Paper & pen to simple video game prototype

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Production

The actual development of the game. It is a continuous and iterative process.
Changes happen all the time.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Design <--> Programming

* Creative directors decide the overall direction <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* Game designers come up with mechanics <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* Gameplay programmers program the mechanics <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* Engine programmers program the platform for the mechanics <!-- .element class="fragment"" -->

<br/>

* Level designers setup the environment <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* Quest designers script missions <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* Tool programmers program the instrumentarium for everyone <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### (Visual) Art Production

* Art directors decide the overall direction <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* Concept artists conceptualize the character / item / place <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* Modelers build a 3D model <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* Texturists / Lightning artists color it <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* Animators and mocap team make it move <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Repeat for other forms of art (sound, cinematics, storyline) <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

The game is constantly played, tested, changed

* don't break the build pls = waste of time for the entire studio

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Milestones

- First playable
- Alpha
- Beta
- Data freeze
- Gold master
- Day 0 patch?

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Post-production

- Maintenance
- DLCs
- Additional platforms

# Why make games as business?

Games do ~~not~~ earn a lot

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Let's talk statistics.

* 2.5 billion gamers worldwide (console / mobile / PC)
* Games earn 3 times more than movies (~$150b)

# What's a game?

* A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* <!-- .element class="fragment" --> 'A series of interesting choices' - Sid Meiers
* A  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
  * **soft-realtime**,
  * **interactive**,
  * **agent-based**
  * **simulation**

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Soft-realtime

* It is important to draw at 60fps (90 / 120 for VR)
* Nobody dies if you miss a frame or have a bug
* And you can hardly [destroy hardware for millions](https://www.simscale.com/blog/2017/12/nasa-mars-climate-orbiter-metric/)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Interactive

* Respond to player input immediately

## Agent-based

* Player(s) *Vs.* other entities *Vs.* the world

# Game engines

* A game engine is a framework for creating games that provides
common reusable functionality
* Often genre-specific
* Writing a engine from a scratch is a huge effort - *don't* do it
* Seriously - don't <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

For real though, don't build your own engine, build a game! <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

# Game Engine requirements

* Vary between genres
  - compare open-world games vs fighting games

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Performance
  - Frames per second >= 60 --> you only have 16 ms!
  - *Very easy* to mess up
  - *Very hard* to get right

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Graphics

* Target hardware
    - Build once, run everywhere
    - Desktop platforms, consoles, mobile
    - STL?

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Artists-and-designer-friendly
    - Non-programmers should also be able to use the engine
    - Designers need editors and scripting languages
    - Artists need a sensible asset pipeline
    - Users shouldn't have to wait an eternity to load a file

# Engine structure

[Click me](resources/01.intro/runtime_arch.jpg)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Hardware, OS, drivers and compilers
  - All platforms have an SDK of their own
  - Different compilers are needed (or better optimized) for specific platforms (i.e. MSVC is better than clang and gcc on Windows)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Third party middleware
  - Standard library
  - Low-level graphics API - DirectX, OpenGL, Metal, GLES
  - Physics simulation - Havok, PhysX, Bullet

Quote from a [Kotaku Article](https://kotaku.com/the-story-behind-mass-effect-andromedas-troubled-five-1795886428)

> Epic’s Unreal Engine is like an SUV, capable of doing lots of things but unable to go at crazy high speeds. The Unity Engine would be a compact car: small, weak, and easy to fit anyplace you’d like. Frostbite is a sports car. Not even a sports car, a Formula 1. When it does something well, it does it extremely well. When it doesn’t do something, it really doesn’t do something.

# Tools of the trade

* Source control - Git vs. Perforce
* IDE - Visual Studio vs. N/A
* Debuggers & Profilers - to be discussed later in the course

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

For the duration of the course you want to have this installed:

* VS 2019 Community Edition
* Git
* Unreal Engine 4 (no need to hurry, more details next time)
* [Optional] Blender & Audacity - if you plan on creating content

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Reminder: The ~~hunger~~ course games are now on, make sure you are up to the challenge.
