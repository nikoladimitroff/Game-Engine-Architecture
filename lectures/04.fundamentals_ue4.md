## Review

# TODO

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

Last time on...'How I met your ~~mother~~ game engine'

* we downloaded and built UE4...did you?
* we talked about those 'module' thingies.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

# TODO: REFACTOR

UE4 uses two main languages for programming

* C++ for all the core stuff
* Blueprints (BP) - a visual scripting language for designers and prototyping
* Blueprints are very helpful for rapid testing and prototyping
* C++ functions and classes can be exposed for usage in Blueprints

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Custom modules

Pay attention, 'tis be thy course project.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* All modules contain a *master* class deriving from [`IModuleInterface`]
(https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/API/Runtime/Core/Modules/IModuleInterface/index.html)
* The master class must be called `I[Something]Module`

```cpp
class ISusiModule : public IModuleInterface
{
    public:
    virtual void StartupModule() override;
    virtual void ShutdownModule() override;
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Module implementation is classic PIMPL
  - Public class that derives from `IModuleInterface`
  - Private class that implements the public class

```cpp
// /SusiModule/Public/SusiModule.h
class ISusiModule : public IModuleInterface {
};

// /SusiModule/Private/SusiModule.cpp
class FSusiModule : public ISusiModule {};
IMPLEMENT_MODULE(FSusiModule, Susi)
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Calling `IMPLEMENT_MODULE` is a requirement!


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## pImpl

*Pointer-to-Implementation* is a technique for reducing coupling
between a class (a library) and its clients

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Pros

* Allows the class implementation to change with recompiling the client
* Reducing compilation times by including *expensive* headers only in
a single source file

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---


### Cons

* Prevents function inlining 
* Adds an extra redirection for each call


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Resources
* (A Twist on pImpl)[http://coherent-labs.com/a-twist-on-pimpl/]
* (A Twist on pImpl Gist)[https://gist.github.com/dimitarcl/3771331/]


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Usage of pImpl

Almost every project is divided in sub-projects according to some
principles. For example:
* Implementation: separating platform specific code
* Aspect: logging, profiling
* Functionality: Rendering


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Usage of pImpl

*pImpl* can be used to implement the interfaces of the internal
libraries in a project

## Games and plugins

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

TODO: uplugin, uproject

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Plugin Distribution

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

#### C++ Library distribution

* complete source
  * header only
  * amalgamation
* prebuilt
  * static libraries
  * dynamic libraries

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

##### Complete source

* Open Source?
* Intellectual property?
  * sell services around the library

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Pros:

* The library is always using the same compiler, `std` library and runtime
* Customers can tweak compiler settings, port to another platform

Cons:

* Support all the possible compilers / IDEs / libraries
    * There are projects using VS 2008, gcc-4.2, etc, ...
    * (Handle mysql.h which does `#define min(a, b) ...`)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

###### Header-only

Just a set of headers

* add the path to the *include paths* of the project
* include a header or two

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Pros:

* Very easy to add to the project

Cons:

* Can have huge impact on compile and link times
* Has to co-exist completely in customer code

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

###### Amalgamation

The entire library in a single source and a single (or couple of) header

* Just add the source file to one of your project files
* Solves the comppile and link times issue

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

##### Prebuilt library

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

###### Static library

Pros:

* less overhead for calls
* chance for link-time optimizations

Cons:

* the library has to use the same compiler/ `std` / runtime as the application
* the library has to be compiled with the same flags as the application
  * debug / release, iterator debug level, optimization options

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

###### Dynamic library

Set of headers and dynamic libraries (and stubs for platforms that need them)

Pros:

* can use different compiler / `std` / runtime than the application
* can use *release* even for *debug*

Cons:

* *must not* transfer ownership of resources between the library and the app
    * *must not* use `std` types in the interface
* Function calls are indirect

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Why not transfer ownership of resources?

* Most resources are handles to resources in the OS / runtime
  * A valid handle in one runtime is not valid in the other
* the memory allocator typically allocates memory in pools. The allocator in the
  library will have different pool than the application. Each allocator doesn't
  know how to free memory allocated from another.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Why not `STL` in the interface?

* One can never know when a `stl` container will allocate / deallocate memory
* STL containers can be different because of compiler versions / flags
  * Visual Studio `vector` in debug stores a list of all of its iterators

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

So, what is a library friendly API?

* Pure `C`
* `C` + interfaces

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

###### Pure `C`

Pros:

* *works* - it will be hard to find incompatible compilers
* easier to use with other languages

Cons:

* `prefix_everthing()` to avoid name clashes
* no overloading

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

###### Hourglass API

```
------ C++ wrapper API
\    /
 \  /
  ||   Pure C API
 /  \
/    \
------ C++ implementation
```

 & [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVYdHDm0q6Y)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### `C` + interfaces

* `C` functions for initialization that return a pure `C++` interface
* `Destroy` method for the interface ???

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```
auto library = InitializeLibrary();
delete library; // will free the memory using the wrong allocator

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

#### Distributing an Unreal Engine 4 plugin

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Most commercial plugins support other commercial and in-house engines
* They are significant IP, so they are not distributted as source (most)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

So most plugins have the following structure:

* a *module* consisting of precompiled dynamic libraries and their headers
  * simply contains the normal C++ API and doesn't have any UE4 related logic
* a *plugin* using the module to make it Unreal Engine aware
  * components, actors, `UObject` integration

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cs
using UnrealBuildTool;

public class MyPlugin : ModuleRules
{
    public CoherentUIGT(TargetInfo Target)
	{
		Type = ModuleType.External;

        string sourceDir = UEBuildConfiguration.UEThirdPartySourceDirectory +
            "MyPlugin/";

        string libDir = sourceDir + "lib/";

        PublicIncludePaths.AddRange(
            new string[] { sourceDir + "include", }
        );

        if (Target.Platform == UnrealTargetPlatform.Win64)
        {
            libDir += "Win64";
            PublicLibraryPaths.Add(libDir);
            PublicAdditionalLibraries.AddRange(
                new string[] { "MyPlugin.lib", }
            );
            PublicDelayLoadDLLs.AddRange(
                new string[] { "MyPlugin.dll", }
            );
		}
        // else all the rest platforms
	}
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

The plugin can be prebuilt or in clear source.

* Prebuilt
  * will need `|UE4 versions| * |platforms| * |configuratons|` versions!

* Clear Source
  * the plugin is a wrapper and should not contain any significant IP
  * with single source, will work for multiple UE4 versions in all
    configurations and all supported platforms
  * customers may look at the code to learn and fix

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

From version 4.0 still Unreal Engine 4, doesn't properly handle prebuilt third
party libraries. Developers are required to manually copy the DLLs in the
packaged game.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

#### Distributing game

`File -> Package game`

1. Cook the content for the chosen platform
2. Compile the game for the chosen platform
3. *Zip* the folder and profit

### Unreal Engine 4 Standard Library

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

`std::vector` ~ `TArray`
`std::unordered_map` ~ `TMap`
`std::unordered_set` ~ `TSet`

`std::map` -> no!
`std::set` -> no!

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Delegates

* C++ does not have standard delegates.
* `std::function` is not enough
