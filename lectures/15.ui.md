# Sanity check

We are recording, aren't we?

## Review

What are joints and skeletons in terms of the animation system?

* A **joint** controls the transformation of a set of vertices in the model's mesh

<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* A **skeleton** is a hierarchy of **joints**,
where each joint's transform affects all of its descendants

<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

What's an animation pose and what's an animation clip?

* A **pose** is a set of fixed values for the transform of each joint in a skeleton.

<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* A **clip** is a list of **poses**.
The animation itself is just interpolation between each pose in the clip.

<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

What's that?

![Anim state machine](resources/13.animation/ue4_state_machine.png)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

The image contains an animation state machine - used to control what animations are played when

* States - control what is played and how are animations blended *(this is the **what**)*
* Transitions - boolean conditions that control when are states changed *(this is the **when**)*

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## User Interface

Everything in the game that allows the user to interact with the game or shows
information about the state of the game that is relevant to the player.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### User Interface

- menus
- chats
- option screens
- help messages
- player health, score, speed of movement
- direction pointers
- quest pointers

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Logic in the UI

- there are some features that can be implemented (almost) entirely in the UI of
  the game
  - chat
  - patch notes
  - parties, guilds, etc
  - inventory operations like stacking and splitting

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Challenges for the User interface

- logic
- animation
- l10n
- scalability
  - 800x600 to 4K
  - 4:3 to 12:3
- automatic layout
- fonts
- mods
- editor

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

Generally all of these are rendered as overlay on the game

- 2D or 3D image
- without depth testing, so it's always above the game world

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### How is the UI created?

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- For very small or simple games, the UI can be created by the programmer
- The artists use Photoshop and Illustrator to create the UI as they image it
  - But what is next?

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Immediate mode UI

http://mollyrocket.com/861

The idea of immediate mode UI is:

- state in the UI and MV** are bloated and hard
- the state is already in the game, just draw it every frame

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

![imgui](resources/15.ui/imgui.png) <!-- .element class="constrain-image-medium" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

##### Implementation

Each frame call a special method
- on each component (only UI components)
- Each component draws what it wants to the screen

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

##### Animations in the UI

Run an animation in the engine and use the animated variables manually.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

##### Implementations

- https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
- https://github.com/memononen/nanovg

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Pros:
- simple to get started

Cons:
- Need a developer for everything
- hard to optimize

  - redraw everything everyframe
  - have a complex system that detects changes and renders only the different
    parts

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

##### Workflow

1. The developer cuts the image into pieces and makes the engine draw each image
  at the appropriate places
  - attaches click handlers to every button
2. The next day the artists see the UI in the game and change what they do not
  like
3. Goto 1 until done

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Unity3D is/was the only engine with immediade mode UI
- The editor still uses immediate mode
- the modern Unity3D UI is created in the 3D editor, just using orthographic
  projection

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Challenges?

- no mods
- everything is manual

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Retained mode

- The UI has a state of its own
  - not everything has to be duplicated
- The game updates the state of the UI
  - "Player health is now 10"
- The UI can affect the state of the game
  - "Restart the level"

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Retained mode
- Allows for clear separation of the game and UI logic
- The artists, game developers and UI developers agree on sets of:
  - data - player score, health etc
  - events
    - notifications from the game to the UI
    - notifications from the UI fo the game

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Retained mode is actually how user interface is working in any application.

MVC

![MVC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/MVC-Process.svg)

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

#### Implementations

- C++
- Scripted
- Flash
- HTML

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Creating Slate widgets - Slate++

```cpp
SNew(SHorizontalBox)
    +SHorizontalBox::Slot()
    .HAlign(HAlign_Left)
    .AutoWidth()
    .Padding(10)
    [
        SNew(SBorder)
        .BorderBackgroundColor(ScreenStyle.BackgroundColor)
        .VAlign(VAlign_Fill)
        .HAlign(HAlign_Fill)
        [
            SNew(STextBlock)
            .Text(TEXT("Hakuna matata")
        ]
    ]
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## HTML

```
<style>
    form {
        background-color: gray;
        border: 1px solid gray;
    }
</style>
<form>
    <label>Enter your credentials</label>
    <label>Username: <input id="username"/></label>
    <label>Password: <input id="password" type="password"/></label>
    <button id="login">Login</button>
</form>
<script>
    document.getElementById("login")
    .addEventListener("click", onLoginButtonClicked);
</script>
```

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

##### C++ User Interface

- good enough to get the game up and running
- allow some data-driven approach later
  - http://www.fltk.org/doc-1.3/fluid.html - generates C++ classes for the UI
  - a Photoshop plugin that allows the artists to define the borders and meta
    data for pieces of the UI, saves this to JSON and the C++ shows the UI
- might have to recompile the game, just to change the color of a button
- hard for l10n

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

##### Scripted User Interface

- Expose the C++ drawing API to Lua, python, JavaScript, etc.
- Expose the game state and events to the scripting language
- The UI can have logic of its own
- Allows user mods
- Still can benefit from data-driven approach

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

##### Implementations
- The most popular combinations
  - Pure Lua
  - XML + Lua
  - XML + JavaScript

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Exposing the game API to the UI
  - can use the existing C++ reflection system and scripting for the gameplay
  - keep the UI scripts signed otherwise someone will cheat
  - user mods can be run in a special isolated environment to prevent cheats and
    allow for security

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

#### Flash

- Own IDE and content format
  - created for 2D content
- One step further in the decomposing the UI system in the game engine
  - own rendering subsystem geared towards 2D graphics
  - own scripting language and VM - ActionScript

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

##### Implementations

- Scaleform by Autodesk
- Iggy by RAD Game tools
- Internal in several studios

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

##### Integration

```
// ...
InitializeUISubsystem();
while (1) {
    // ...
    UpdateUI(now);
    DrawUI();
}
UnitializeUISubsystem();
// ...
```

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

##### HTML

- widespread, open and standartized languages
- naturally separates UI logic from UI styles
- l10n
- automatic layout

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Pros:
- HTML is here to stay and is picking up
- lots of tools, libraries, etc

Cons:
- the freedom in choices can be overwhelming

### Fonts

Text rendering is essential for any UI

Fonts can be:
- raster - each glyph is just a 2D image and the font contains the images for a
  certain number of sizes and styles <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
- vector - each glyph is a collection of primitives <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
  - for TrueType fonts - straight line segments and quadratic Bezier curves
  - the font can contain a single definition for each symbol, it is scaled by
    the software for the appropriate size and style

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

When a text with raster font is rendered on the screen, the text is rasterized
in a texture and the texture is rendered.

- can use a lot of video memory
  - texture compression will make the font look bad
- can use a lot of CPU for the rasterization

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

With raster fonts, we can use a single texture for the font size and style and
draw each letter directly with the appropriate texture coordinates.

- large vertex and index buffers <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
- not scallable when there are a lot of different font sizes and styles and
  symbols <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
  - Players can not have № in their name 
- l10n - we might need a texture with almost every unicode symbol possible <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

With vector fonts, we have to create a raster image of the glyph before we can
draw it

- single font for all sizes and styles - can contain more symbols
- rasterization is not trivial
- anti-aliasing

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

http://www.slideshare.net/Mark_Kilgard/23typography-12534604

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Pre-rasterize the font
http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/
- Signed Distance Field - SDF

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### SDF

Signed Distance fields store the distance to the nearest non-black pixel in the
bitmap image
- instead of the intensity at the pixel

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Pre-rasterize the font at huge size - 4096x4096 <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
- From the bitmap compute the distance field and store it in 8 bit texture <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
- For each texel in the output, determine whether the orignating pixel in the <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
  image is *in* or *out* and the distance in texels to the neareast texel of the
  opposite kind
- map the output in 0 - inside, 1 - outside, 0.5 - exactly the border of the
  letters <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
- much better works with the linear interpolation in the GPU <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
- loss of sharpness <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
