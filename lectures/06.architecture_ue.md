# Sanity check

We are recording, aren't we?

## Review

What is `Cooking`?

The process of optimizing the game's content for
the target platform.
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

What are `UFunction`s and `UProperty`s?

Macros which mark functions / data for Unreal to care about -
this makes them usable in the editor / Blueprints, or adds other benefits like
network replication
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

UE has 4 types of strings. What's their purpose?


| Method     | Explanation |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `TCHAR*` | Properly-encoded, null-terminated string <!-- .element class="fragment" --> |
| `FString` | A mutable, standard string class  <!-- .element class="fragment" --> |
| `FText`     | Localized, immutable string, used for output <!-- .element class="fragment" --> |
| `FName` | Interned, immutable string, used for identification <!-- .element class="fragment" --> |

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

What is `UObject`?

The base class for (almost) everything, provides:

* Automatic memory management (via Garbage collection)
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* Automatic serialization / editor integration (via reflection)
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

What do these 2 declarations do?

```cpp
DECLARE_DELEGATE_TwoParams(FOnNewAssetRequested,
    const FString&,
    TWeakObjectPtr<UClass>);
DECLARE_MULTICAST_DELEGATE(FOnCompilerNotFound);
```

* `FOnNewAssetRequested` is a single cast delegate matching `void Foo(const FString&, TWeakObjectPtr<UClass>)`

<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

* `FOnCompilerNotFound` is a multicast cast delegate matching `void Foo()`

<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

<!-- .slide: id="modules-overview" -->

## Modules

* Modules are UE's custom libraries.
* They can be linked either statically or dynamically.
* They can be delay loaded.
* They have a well-defined interface for (de)initialization.
* The engine detects modules dynamically and there are plenty
of dependency injection opportunities

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

...
Modules improve reusability...

![Reusability kitten](resources/02.intro_ue/kitten_fits_sits.jpg) <!-- .element class="constrain-image" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

...
* Extensibility
* Maintainability
* Decoupling
* Efficiency
* Iteration time

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Modules are the key to having developing the engine, games and
plugins *look* and *feel* identical.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Engine modules breakdown

All core modules are located under */Engine/Source/* and
placed into one of these categories<sup>1</sup>:

| Type       | Purpose                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Developer  | Usable in the Editor & Programs     |
| Editor     | Usable in the Editor only           |
| Runtime    | Usable everywhere                   |
| ThirdParty | External code from other companies  |
| Plugins    | Extensions for Editor and / or Game |

<sup>1</sup> Plugins are stored in */Engine/Plugins* and */[Game]/Plugins*.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Some important modules

| Module         | Purpose                                                                              |

## And some cool modules

| Module                    | Purpose                                       |

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

As of 5.1.1, there are **543** modules!

Before implementing a new feature by hand, check whether it's not already there


--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Solution structure

* All projects are in the same solution
* Project files are all generated
* If you need to regenerate the solution,
right-click the uproject in Explorer / Finder
    - Can also be achieved via *GenerateProjectFiles.bat*
    for more options
* Ignore the 'Project is out of date' warning
* Do not create new C++ files from inside VS!

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Solution configurations

* Configurations follow the pattern *[Optimization Level] [Target]*
* Optimization levels:
    - Debug & DebugGame
    - Development
    - Shipping
    - Test
* Targets:
    - None
    - Editor
    - Client
    - Server

## Game structure

The engine, plugins and games share the same structure

| Directory | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| /Binaries | Executables & shared libraries                               |
| /Build    | Helper files for building the engine. Mostly batch files.    |
| /Config   | Configuration files.                                         |
| /Content  | Assets. The editor directory is shared between all projects. |

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

...

| Directory         | Description                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| /DerivedDataCache | Cached content data files (Engine only) |
| /Intermediate     | Temporary build products                |
| /Plugins          | Shared and project specific plug-ins    |
| /Saved            | Autosaves, logs, screenshots, etc.      |
| /Source           | Source code for all the things!         |

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Every Unreal project and the engine itself is separated into ***modules***.

* A module is a collection of code that implements some functionality.
UBT builds each module as a separate library.
* All code must belong to a module.
* A C++ game / plugin must contain at least one module.
    - Games done entirely in Blueprints don't need modules.
    - Plugins that only contain content do not have modules.
* Creating a project also creates a module with the same name.
* Your C++ code goes to *Source/[ModuleName]*.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Game structure

Several files are essential for each project:

| File                                        | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *[GameName].uproject*                       | Stores general info - the engine version for the game, module structure. |
| *Source/[GameName].Target.cs*               | Used to setup the build environment for the *game*                       |
| *Source/[GameName]Editor.Target.cs*         | Used to setup the build environment for the *game* in the Editor         |
| *Source/[ModuleName]/[ModuleName].Build.cs* | Used to setup the build environment for each *module*                    |

#### Game descriptor

```js
{
    "FileVersion": 3,
    "EngineAssociation": "{057B6751-43BC-4BA7-0068-58824477289A}",
    "Category": "",
    "Description": "",
    "Modules": [
        {
            "Name": "UE5TopDownARPG",
            "Type": "Runtime",
            "LoadingPhase": "Default"
        }
    ]
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Target rules

```cs
public class UE5TopDownARPG : TargetRules
{
	public UE5TopDownARPG(TargetInfo Target) : base(Target)
	{
		Type = TargetType.Game;

		ExtraModuleNames.AddRange( new string[] { "UE5TopDownARPG" } );
	}
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Module rules

```cs
public class UE5TopDownARPG : ModuleRules
{
    public UE5TopDownARPG(TargetInfo Target)
    {
        PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[]
            { "Core", "CoreUObject", "Engine", "InputCore" }
        );
        PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "UMG" });
        PrivateIncludePaths.Add("/Path/To/UE5TopDownARPG/Api");
    }
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Plugins have the exact same structure - except their project
file is *[PluginName].uplugin* instead of *[GameName].uproject*.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## To git or not to git

When making your own projects, you only need the following files
and directories under source control:

* */Config*
* */Content*
* */Source*
* [GameName].uproject

It's dangerous to go alone! Take this
[*.gitignore*](https://gist.github.com/k1p1/f464a24aa2920a19552e20df3c82ff02)
[*.gitattributes*](https://gist.github.com/k1p1/50c373e27e2a78f05c5e053492c09316).


--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## For example...

*Launch[YourPlatform].cpp* contains the engine's `main` (e.g. *LaunchWindows.cpp*)

If you were to remove all the details in it, you'll get something like this:

```cpp
int main()
{
    FEngineLoop GEngineLoop;
    GEngineLoop.Init();
    while (!GIsRequestingExit)
    {
        GEngineLoop.Tick();
    }
    GEngineLoop.Exit();
}
```

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Game object model

the set of programming primitives
used to represent any object in the world.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## UE game object model

* UE is a mixture between OOP and component orientated design
  - Gameplay is component-based
  - OOP is widely used for creating reusable templates

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
UCLASS(config=Game)
class AUE5TopDownARPGCharacter : public ACharacter
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
    /** Camera boom positioning the camera behind the character */
    UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly)
    USpringArmComponent* CameraBoom;

    /** Follow camera */
    UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly)
    UCameraComponent* FollowCamera;

    UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly)
    UE5TopDownARPGComponent* Connection;
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
UCLASS(BlueprintType)
class UE5TOPDOWNARPG_API UE5TopDownARPGComponent : public UActorComponent
{
    virtual void BeginPlay() override;
    virtual void TickComponent(float DeltaTime, ...) override;
    /// Requests the user data to be reloaded from UE5TopDownARPG.
    UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category="UE5TopDownARPG")
    void RequestDataReload();

    /// The data loaded for the student.
    UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly)
    FStudentInfo LoadedStudentInfo;

    DECLARE_DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATE(FInfoLoadedDelegate);
    /// Notifies the client when the data for the user has been loaded.
    UPROPERTY(BlueprintAssignable)
    FInfoLoadedDelegate OnInfoLoaded;
}
```

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## UE Gameplay subsystem

- Worlds, full of
  - Actors, full of
    - Components, Classes, Structs, full of
      - Properties and Functions
  - Some UObjects are NOT Actors

* Can be accessed through code, Blueprints, the editor.
* There is more than one world while you are using the Editor.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Everything that is in the world is an actor
* Each actor has different components
* Components can be
  - `Tick`-ed every frame
  - Notified when certain events occurs on the owner object

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Actors

* Can be placed into a level
* Support 3D transformations
* Contain Root component
* Can contain components

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Actor Spawning

```cpp
AActor* UWorld::SpawnActor
(
    UClass*         Class,
    FName           InName,
    FVector const*  Location,
    FRotator const* Rotation,
    ...
)
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Actor Lifecycle

* Actor is spawned
* `PostInitializeComponents` - Called after the Actor's components have been initialized
* `BeginPlay` - Game started
* `BeginDestroy` - free up memory and begin releasing other resources
* `FinishDestroy` - object is really going to be destroyed

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Unreal and Actors

* Unreal may create instances of your Actors whenever it likes!
* Never do complicated things in the constructor / destructor
  * Use `PostInitializeComponent` / `BeginDestroy`
* Neither rely on that there will be only a single instance

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Components

* Special type of Object that Actors can attach to themselves as sub-objects
* Useful for sharing common behaviors
* Have a bunch of virtual functions you can override!

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## 3 Types of Components

* `UActorComponent` - abstract behaviors and non-physical concepts
* `USceneComponent` - has a position / rotation
* `UPrimitiveComponent` - has some geometry (can be rendered / collided)

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Game Mode

* Governs the rules of the game
* Only the server has an instance (for cheat prevention)
* Spawn gameplay relevant Actors there

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Game State

* Keeps the state of the game (Score, Teams, etc.)
* Every player has a copy
* You need to synchronize it in Multiplayer Games

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Games and plugins

Plugins are mini-games!

* Content
* Resources
* Code

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Plugins might just be a bunch of code and/or assets.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Some commercial plugins support other commercial and in-house systems
* These systems are significant IP, so they are not distributed as source (most)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

These Plugins have the following structure:

* a *module* consisting of precompiled dynamic libraries and their headers
  * simply contains the normal C++ API and doesn't have any UE related logic
* a *plugin* using the module to make it Unreal Engine aware
  * components, actors, `UObject` integration

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Distributing game

`File -> Package game`

1. Cook the content for the chosen platform
2. Compile the game for the chosen platform
3. *Zip* the folder and profit

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Plugin Distribution

1. Delete *Intermediate*, *Build*, *Binaries* and *Saved*
2. Zip your plugin
3. Unzip your plugin at the destination
4. Enable the plugin
5. ???
6. Profit!
