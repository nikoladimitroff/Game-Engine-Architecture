## Review

What's the difference between these files?

## Review

Judging by the names of these classes, what can you tell about them?

| Class               | Info                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FDirectoryWatcher` | <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> A standard C++ class |
| `TFunction`         | <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> A template class     |

<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" --> What other prefixes were there?

# Fundamentals 

1. C++ Review and Best Practices (smart pointers, iterators, error handling, libraries, unity builds)
1. Pipelines, Caches and Optimization
1. Tools support

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## C++

* Most games are written in C/C++
* Even games that are not written in C++, have C++ at their core
  * the Platform-independence layer
  * parts of the Core layer, if not the entire one
* Or languages that are not C++, but close enough
  * [Jonathan Blow - A new programming language for
    games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH9VCN6UkyQ&list=PLmV5I2fxaiCKfxMBrNsU1kgKJXD3PkyxO)

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Not your "standard" C++

* C++ is used because it gives you the power (to shoot yourself in the foot)
* Standard C++ doesn't give enough control / power
  * no matter the version of the language - '98, '03, '11, '14, '17?


--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Input-Output

* **no** `iostream`
  * hidden allocations
  * hidden global lock for the locale
* `FILE*`

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Smart Pointers

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

Smart pointers help to properly manage the lifetimes of resources.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

*Smart pointer* is a object with overridden

* `operator*()`
* `operator->()`
* `explicit operator bool()`

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

#### `std::unique_ptr`

C++ 11 introduces `std::unique_ptr`

* it is not copyable
* it is moveable
* `std::unique_ptr` owns the resource it is pointing to.
  Use this to express ownership relation between types

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### `std::unique_ptr<T>` synopsis

* `unique_ptr()` default constructor
* `unique_ptr(Y*)` constructor - allows using pointers to
  `Derived` classes to be hold in `std::unique_ptr<Base>`

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* `T& operator* ()`
* `T* operator-> ()`
* `const T& operator* () const`
* `const T* operator-> () const`
* `T* get()` - get the underlying pointer
* `const T* get() const`

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* `T* release()` - get the underlying pointer and release
  ownership over it. Use it when you need to give up the ownership of the
  resource

* `void reset(T* new_pointer = nullptr)` - reset the underlying
  pointer to `new_pointer` and get ownership over it. Deletes the current
  pointer.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

`explicit operator bool()`
            
Allows usage such as

    std::unique_ptr<T> p;
    if (p) {
        std::cout << *p << std::endl;
    }
    
--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

`std::unique_ptr` has a second template parameter

    template <typename T, typename Deleter = std::default_delete<T>>
    class unique_ptr
    {
        ~unique_ptr() {
            auto deleter = get_deleter();
            deleter(m_Pointer);
        }
    };

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Bad
    
    std::unique_ptr<Enemy> enemies(new Enemy[42]);

Will make a `delete` to memory allocated with `new []`.

Why is this bad?

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---
## Good

    std::unique_ptr<Enemy[]> enemies(new Enemy[42]);

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

`T& operator[](size_t index)` - allows array element access.  Only
`std::unique_ptr<T[]>` has this method. 

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Custom deleter

    struct ReleaseDelete {
        template <typename T>
        void operator()(T* pointer) {
            pointer->Release();
        }
    };

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
class Renderer {
    std::unique_ptr<ID3D11Device, ReleaseDelete> device;
};
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

`std::unique_ptr` is so "simple", so the standard gets it almost perfect.


--- NEXT SLIDE ---

#### `std::shared_ptr`

Reference counted pointer that allows shared ownership over a resource.
The resource is destroyed when the last reference to it is destroyed.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

##### Reference Counting and cycles

If you have a cycle in the references between resources in
`std::shared_ptr`, these resources will never be freed.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

##### How to handle cyclic references?

* manually by breaking the cycle
* use *weak* references

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

###### `std::weak_ptr`

*Weak* references point to a resource, but do not prolong its lifetime.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
std::weak_ptr<int> w;
{
    std::shared_ptr<int> s = std::make_shared<int>(42);
    w = s;
}
if (auto pointer = w.lock()) {
    std::cout << *pointer << std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout << "It's gone" << std::endl;
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
template <typename T>
class weak_ptr {
    // ...
    shared_ptr lock() {
        if (<It is still alive>) {
            return shared_ptr<T>(<for It>);
        }
        return shared_ptr();
    }
};
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### *Intrusive* reference counting

The reference count is stored in the resource (object) itself.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### When to use `intrusive_ptr`?

* some external APIs are already reference counted
    * OS, other languages
* more memory and cache friendly than `shared_ptr`

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

##### `std::shared_ptr` is bad

* no support for intrusive reference counting
* no control over the type of the reference count
  * is it thread safe? Is it using atomic operations? Or a mutex?


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

##### `offset_ptr`

* `offset` pointers store an offset from their address to the pointee
* Normal pointers store absolute addresses


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

It allows storing complex data in a single blob, instead of scattered objects.

The single blob is better:
* We can load/save it with a single read/write
* *Cache friendly*

### Memory management

C++ has support for custom memory management

* global `operator new` and `operator delete` are overridable
* you can overload `operator new` and `operator delete`
* *new_handler*
* each class can define its own `operator new`, `operator delete`, `operator
  new[]`, `operator delete[]`
* STL containers have support for custom allocators

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

References:

* [`operator new`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/new/operator_new)
* [`operator
  delete`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/new/operator_delete)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Overriding `new`

    void* operator new(std::size_t size);
    void* operator new[](std::size_t size);
    void* operator new(std::size_t size, const std::no_throw_t&);
    void* operator new[](std::size_t size, const std::no_throw_t&);

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Overriding `delete`

    void operator delete(void* ptr);
    void operator delete[](void* ptr);
    void operator delete(void* ptr, const std::nothrow_t&);
    void operator delete[](void* ptr, const std::nothrow_t&);
    void operator delete(void* ptr, std::size_t size); // *
    void operator delete[](void* ptr, std::size_t size); // *

* *** are C++14, but it is implementation defined whether they are called at all

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Cons

These operators are global

* no information from the call site or the type
* no state (except global)
* prone to need mutex for multithreading

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Placement `new`

    char buffer[256];
    auto player = new (buffer) Player;
    // Will construct Player in buffer

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---
    
    player->~Player();
    // will destroy the player instance, but will leave the memory allocated


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
void* operator new(std::size_t size, void* ptr);
void* operator new[](std::size_t size, void* ptr);
void* operator new(std::size_t size, user-defined-args...);
void* operator new[](std::size_t size, user-defined-args...);
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
struct LinearAllocator {
    void* Allocate(size_t size) { 
        if (offset + size > buffer_size) return 0; // and crash!
        auto ptr = buffer + offset;
        offset += size;
        return ptr;
    }
    char* buffer;
    int offset;
    int buffer_size;
} g_PerFrameAllocator;
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
void* operator new(std::size_t size, LinearAllocator* allocator) {
    return allocator->Allocate(size);
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
auto models = new (&g_PerFrameAllocator) Models;
// will create a new instance in the memory returned by the per-frame
// allocator
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

How does one delete a object allocated with custom allocator?

* There is no custom syntax for `delete`!
* Invent your own

```cpp
template <typename Allocator, typename T>
void Destroy(Allocator* allocator, T* instance) {
    instance->~T();
    allocator->Deallocate(allocator);
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Per-class operators `new` and `delete`

```cpp
struct Pawn
{
    static void* operator new(std::size_t size);
    static void* operator new[](std::size_t size);
    static void operator delete(void* ptr);
    static void operator delete[](void* ptr);
};
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* called with normal syntax
      
      auto pawn = new Pawn;
      delete pawn;

* they get inherited
* Inconvenient if you need to use Pawn with different allocators

#### STL allocator

* [`allocator`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/allocator)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Changes the type of the collection

* `std::vector<int, PerFrameAllocator>` is completely different type from
  `std::vector<int, ScopedAllocator>`
* worse - this goes to their iterators too!

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

This makes it impossible to reuse algorithms and functions that work on
containers with different allocators.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

It is almost always rebound to another type

* `std::map` allocator allocates tree nodes, not `pair<Key, Value>`

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

No state!

There is no guarantees whether the rebound allocator will be constructed with
your allocator, so you have no way to pass / store state in the allocator!

### Error handling

* Error hanlding in the language
    * C - error codes
    * C++ - exceptions
* Error handling in the real world

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* error codes are error prone
* exceptions are poorly implemented


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Exceptions

* have performance impact even when there no exceptions
  * on Windows function calls become significantly more expensive
  * GCC/CLANG use a static jump table, which makes the executable larger

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Exceptions are frawned upon in many environments
  * forbidded on the previous generation of consoles (no runtime support)
  * off-by-default on Android / iOS (you want your game small!)
  * off-by-default on last generation of consoles


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Error handling in the real world

* Logging
* Assertions
* Crash-handling

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

##### Logging

Having only an error (with an callstack if we are lucky) often is not enough.

Logging is essential for understanding what is going on with the program.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* There is no standard `C++` library for logging.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

###### Choosing a logging library

* Logging is an aspect of the program
* It crawls all over the place

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

###### Logging libraries


* [glog][glog]
* [boost log][boost]
* Lots of them on github
* roll your own (at least for fun)

[glog]: https://code.google.com/p/google-glog/
[boost]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/libs/log/doc/html/index.html

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

###### Criteria

* Severities, may be even facilities
* log rotation
* compile time and run-time impact

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

###### What to log?

* Not too much (it is not free), but enough to understand what
  is going on.
* All important points in the lifetime of the application.
* Log only in case of errors - [error context][error]
  [error]: http://bitsquid.blogspot.com/2012/01/sensible-error-handling-part-1.html

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Assertions

* `assert`
  * only in `_DEBUG` builds
  * only aborts the program, at best you get the callstack

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Custom assert mechanism

* turned off only for *shipping* builds
* gathers callstack, logs, everything possible

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Crash reporting

At the end there will be crashes

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

All operating systems allow registering of custom callback to be called when the
  application crashes

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

You gather everything you can about the state and send it back home to be
examined.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---


### [Breakpad](https://code.google.com/p/google-breakpad/)

* portable
* allows automatic crash dump analysis



--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

* STL

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### STL containers

* no control over allocation patterns
* some containers allocate even when empty!

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Standard Template Library

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* poor memory managament

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* poor portability
    - The standard requires only O-notation for certain operations, all the
    rest is implementation defined
    - `std::string` in GCC (libstdc++) prior to 5.0 is using `copy-on-write`
    - The rest are using small string optimization


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* poor control
    * `std::thread`,
    * `std::async`
    * `std::atomic<int64_t>`

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

##### Alternatives

* EASTL - fixes the allocator issues of STL.
  https://github.com/electronicarts/EASTL
* Bitsquid Foundation library
* folly
* STLport

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Custom containers

* custom containers will require custom iterators

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
for (auto& pawn: pawns) {
    // actually calls begin(pawns) and end(pawns) and expects iterator
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
template <typename Iterator>
struct iterator_traits {
    typedef typename Iterator::difference_type difference_type;
    typedef typename Iterator::value_type value_type;
    typedef typename Iterator::pointer pointer;
    typedef typename Iterator::reference reference;
    typedef typename Iterator::iterator_category iterator_category;
};
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* `operator *`, `operator ->`
* `operator ==`, `operator != `
* `operator ++`, `operator ++(int)`
* `operator --`, `operator --(int)`

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

All `pointer`-like semantics:

* `operator[]`
* `operator <`, `operator <=`,
* `operator >`, `operator >=`,
* `explicit operator bool`  (or SafeBool idiom)
* `operator !`

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

#### There is hope

There is a working group that thinks how to improve C++

* [Towards improved support for games, graphics, real-time, low latency,
embedded systems.](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4456.pdf)

* SCARY iterators

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Unity builds

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Instead of:

    compile Player.cpp -o Player.o
    compile Pawn.cpp -o Pawn.o
    link Player.o Pawn.o ... -o game.exe

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

all.cpp:

    #include "Player.cpp"
    #include "Pawn.cpp"

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

    compile all.cpp -o game.exe

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Pros:

* compiler sees everything, can optimize the program much better
* no duplicated reading of the same header over and over again
* no linking

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Cons:

* a single change will recompile everything


--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Performance

The keys to getting the most performance of CPUs is cache locallity of the
executed code

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Cache enemies:

* `std::list`
* `std::map`, `std::set`

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* `std::shared_ptr`
    * one pointer-chase for the RC
    * one pointer-chase for the actual object

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* `virtual` functions
    * one pointer-chase for the objects v-table
    * one pointer-chase for the object itself
    * code cache - sorting objects by type

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Optimizations

Shipping games are built with every optimization possible!

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

This leads to Subtle, shipping only bugs

* static analysis may detect undefined behaviour

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Link-time optimizations

* Allow the linker to generate code
    * inline functions accross objects
    * devirtualize calls


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Static linking

* games are preferrably linked into a single executable, without dynamic
  libraries
* dynamic libraries are used to speed up development

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Static linking allows

* more inlining
* less overhead when calling functions
    * DLL boundary is calling a function through pointer
    * On Posix it is even worse (symbols are lazy bound)
* no DLL hell (games need to run on every possible PC out there)

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Tools

C++ lacks tooling.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Build systems

* `make`
* `ninja`

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Project generation systems

Allow taking advantage of the native IDE (Visual Studio, Xcode, Eclipse)

* `cmake`
* `premake`, `genie`
* `gyp`

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Cross compiling

* There are projects that allow using Visual Studio with gcc/clang as a cross-compilation tool
    * vs-android
* Visual Studio 2015 supports compiling and debugging for Android and iOS

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Debuggers

* Visual Studio
* Xcode
* gdb / lldb
* Minitrace
* RAD Game Tools are working on something!

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Graphical tooling

* NSight
* AMD PerfTools
* Visual Studio
* Xcode
* Platform Specific - for consoles
* https://github.com/Celtoys/Remotery

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Performance profilers

Performance profiling changes the behaviour of the program!

* Intel VTune
* Project pin - allows instrumenting the binary
* Visual Studio
* Xcode
* VerySleepy - sampling profiling
* minitrace
