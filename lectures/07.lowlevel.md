# Sanity check

We are recording, aren't we?

## Review

#### How do we use time in games?

* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> Use it for all gameplay purposes
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> Don't accumulate it
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" --> Don't use floats for storage

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### What's an entity and what's a component?

Components are pieces of code which implement some
functionality of a game object like making it fly or shoot. Entities are game objects - collections
of components which behave in some way in the world.

<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Compare & contrast

| Method | Explanation |
| ---    | ----------- |
| Array of Structures | <!-- .element class="fragment" --> Fast to develop, slow to execute, useful in the editor |
| Structure of Arrays | <!-- .element class="fragment" --> Slow to develop, fast to execute, useful in the runtime  |

## Low-level systems

1. Subsystem start and shutdown
1. Logging
1. Input.
1. Memory Management. Allocators. Garbage Collection
1. Resources and file system. Cooking and baking content
1. Reflection and serialization.
1. Configuration

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Subsystems

Aren't always compatible with the ECS model because they need to preserve outside state.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Memory Management
- Logging
- IO and Assets
- Networking
- Physics
- Input
- Visual Effects
- Rendering
- Gameplay
- Scripting

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

How is a subsystem represented in the code?

- (often) a separate library
- (often) a singleton

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### A separate library

- properly separated interface from implementation
  - can be tested in isolation
  - better build times
  - plugin systems
    - 2D vs 3D physics / rendering
    - different scripting engines
    - only cooked content in production builds

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### A singleton

For some subsystems it is convenient to be implemented as a singleton

- Allocator per subsystem
- Logger
- IO
- Scripting Engine
- ...

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

##### Singleton Proper style

```
extern Allocator* g_Allocator;
extern Logger* g_Logger;
int main() {
    g_Allocator = Memory::Initialize();
    g_Logger = Logging::Initialize();

    while (1) {
        // enjoy
    }

    Logging::Shutdown(g_Logger);
    Memory::Shutdown(g_Allocator);
    return 0;
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Order is explicit (so are dependencies)
- Order of `shutdown` might be different
- There are other ways to do Singleton, but this is C++ specific,
and has nothing to do with engine design

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Logging

Let's start with the simplest system

Logging helps us understand the flow of the program.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### A good logging library has

* Severities so you can ignore unimportant info but still have it there if needed
* Categories so you can filter messages in one system
* Log to file, console, etc.
* Timing info

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### A good logging library has

* Small compile time and run-time impact
* A log viewer

![Demo viewer](resources/07.lowlevel/yalv_logging_viewer.png)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
Logger* gLogger;
...
void SpawnEntity(const EntityDescription& d)
{
    ...
    if (too many entities)
    {
        logger->Log(Severity::Error,
            Category::SpawningService,
            "Couldn't spawn requested entity of type <%s>",
            d.TypeName);
        // [1.1.1970 23:59:59][Spawning] Error: Couldn't spawn <Altair>
    }
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
void UHealthComponent::OnDamageTaken(float Damage, AActor* Instigator)
{
    // Character <Bowser> was damaged by <5> points by <Mario>
    UE_LOG(LogCharacter,
        Info,
        TEXT("Character <%s> was damaged by <%f> points by <%s>"),
        *(GetOwner()->GetName()),
        MyCharacter->Health,
        *(Instigator->GetName()));
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Choosing a logging library

* There is no standard `C++` library for logging.
* Logging is an aspect of the program
* It crawls all over the place

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Logging libraries

* [glog][glog]
* [boost log][boost]
* Lots of them on github
* roll your own (at least for fun)

[glog]: https://code.google.com/p/google-glog/
[boost]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/libs/log/doc/html/index.html

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

###### What to log?

* Not too much (it is not free), but enough to understand what
  is going on.
* All important points in the lifetime of the application
    * Acquiring and releasing resources
    * Creating and destroying game entities
    * Machine info, game version

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Crash reporting

At the end there will be crashes

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

All operating systems allow registering of custom callback to be called
when the application crashes

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

You gather everything you can about the state

* Log, minidump, last frame screenshot
* Start a separate process because the current one isn't stable and tell the user
* Send it all back home to be examined

If you are interested in the technical internals - start by checking out
[CaptureStackBackTrace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/bb204633(v=vs.85)?redirectedfrom=MSDN)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Popular crash handlers libraries

[Breakpad](https://code.google.com/p/google-breakpad/)

* portable
* allows automatic crash dump analysis

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Input management

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
void Update()
{
    if (IsButtonDown(Button::MouseLeft))
    {
        Fire();
    }
    if (IsButtonDown(Button::W))
    {
        MoveForward(PLAYER_SPEED);
    }
}
```

Right? <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
void Update()
{
    // 1. You'll fire multiple times a second!
    // 2. No way to change the button by a player / designer!
    // 3. What if we you can use different buttons for the same action?
    if (IsButtonDown(Button::MouseLeft))
    {
        Fire();
    }
    // 4. If you are using a gamepad, you want to know
    // how MUCH was the stick pressed!
    if (IsButtonDown(Button::W))
    {
        MoveForward(PLAYER_SPEED); // 5. DON'T FORGET DELTA TIME!!!
    }
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

We can do this, I guess

```cpp
void Update()
{
    const bool shouldFire = IsButtonDown(GetButtonForFire()) &&
        !WasButtonDown(GetButtonForFire());
    if (shouldFire)
    {
        Fire();
    }
}
```

But it's still hard to reason about input actions! <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

A good input system:

1. Allows you to check the state now and before
1. Allows you to modify buttons
1. Allows you to read the *amount* of change
1. Maps action to inputs in *data*!

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### An example input system

Store the data we need

```cpp
enum DigitalButton
{
    KeyW, KeyA, KeyS, KeyD, ..., MouseLeft, ..., GamepadRB, ...,
    Count
};
enum AnalogButton
{
    MouseWheel, ..., GamepadRT, ...,
    Count
};
class InputManager
{
    std::bitset<DigitalButton::Count> m_LastFrameDigital;
    std::bitset<DigitalButton::Count> m_CurrentFrameDigital;
    float m_LastFrameAnalog[AnalogButtons::Count];
    float m_CurrentFrameAnalog[AnalogButtons::Count];
    ...
};
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Update the data from the OS

```cpp
LRESULT CALLBACK DefaultWindowProc(HWND hWnd, UINT message,
    WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
    switch (message)
    {
    case WM_KEYDOWN:
        DigitalButton b = ConvertWindowKeyToOurs(wParam);
        InputManager->m_CurrentFrameAnalog[b] = true;
    }
    ...
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Update previous frame

```cpp
void InputManager::Update()
{
    m_LastFrameDigital = m_CurrentFrameDigital;
    std::memcpy(m_LastFrameAnalog,
        m_CurrentFrameAnalog,
        sizeof(m_LastFrameAnalog));
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Allow users to define actions and bindings

```cpp
class InputManager
{
    using DelegateCallback = std::function<void()>;
    void RegisterAction(Name actionName, DelegateCallback callback);
    void BindInputToAction(Name actionName, DigitalButton button);
    void BindInputToAction(Name actionName, AnalogButton button);
    ...
};
```


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Trigger all events

```cpp
// Stores all data about an action - which button should be
// pressed, for how long, the callback function, etc.
struct Action
{
    ... 
    bool MatchesInputState();
    void Invoke();
};
void InputManager::DispatchActions()
{
    for (Action& action : m_Actions)
    {
        if (action.MatchesInputState())
        {
            action.Invoke();
        }
    }
};
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Present an interface to designers / players

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Memory management

C++ has custom memory management
(*which is why we use it in the first place*)

* Stack variables and `operator new` *know* how to allocate memory
* But we can override them!

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Memory basics

* By default, `new / delete ` usually call `malloc / free`
* `malloc` & `free` are the functions for memory in C
* `malloc` & `free` ask the OS for memory
  * e.g. by calling [VirtualAlloc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc) on Windows

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
void* memory = malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
int* myArrayOf5Elements = static_cast<int*>(memory);
myArrayOf5Elements[3] = 42;
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Operator `new` actually does 2 things

* Requests memory
* Calls constructors

Operator `delete` actually does 2 things

* Calls destructors
* Frees memory

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Placement new

Placement `new`

```cpp
// Allocate memory (stack, heap, w/e)
char buffer[256];
// Construct Player in buffer
auto player = new (buffer) Player;
// Destroy the player instance, but memory is still allocated
player->~Player();
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

`operator new` can be overloaded with random other arguments

```cpp
void* operator new(std::size_t size, void* ptr);
void* operator new(std::size_t size, user-defined-args...);
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Enter allocators

Allocators are objects which know how to allocate memory in a good way

* We use different allocators for different objects
* Know your data to best select an allocator
* You rarely have to pick an allocator when writing everyday code. Stick to defaults!

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Linear allocators

The greatest for temporary data

- Preallocate a block of memory
- `allocate` portions of this block using a stack behaviour
  - `allocate` just moves a pointer further in the block
  - `free` *should* move the pointer back

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

![Stack Allocator](resources/07.lowlevel/stack.jpg)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
struct LinearAllocator {
    // Statically allocate 1 MB of memory
    char m_Buffer[1024 * 1024];
    int m_Offset;
    int m_BufferSize;
    void* Allocate(size_t size)
    {
        if (offset + size > m_BufferSize)
            return nullptr; // or crash!

        auto ptr = m_Buffer + m_Offset;
        m_Offset += size;
        return ptr;
    }
} g_PerFrameAllocator;
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

[Sample
implementation](https://stoyannk.wordpress.com/2015/05/31/temporary-allocations-in-c/)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
void* operator new(std::size_t size, LinearAllocator* allocator)
{
    return allocator->Allocate(size);
}
...
// Create a new instance in the memory of the per-frame allocators
auto models = new (&g_PerFrameAllocator) Models();
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Working with custom allocated objects
`std::unique_ptr` has a second template parameter

```cpp
struct CustomDeleter
{
    void operator()(void* p)
    {
        std::cout << "Instance " << p << " is dead now";
    }
};
...
std::unique_ptr<NPC, CustomerDeleter> npc;
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

How does one delete an object allocated with custom allocator?

```cpp
template<typename T>
struct PerFrameDeleter
{
    void operator()(void* instance)
    {
        instance->~T();
        g_PerFrameAllocator->Deallocate(instance);
    }
};
...
std::unique_ptr<Player, PerFrameDeleter<Player>> player
    (new (&g_PerFrameAllocator) Player());
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### STL allocator

STL containers support custom
[`allocators`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/allocator)
to an extent and most engines override the defaults.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Why use custom allocators?

* Memory is limited
  * PC -> Shipping a title for China -> XP - 32 bit, 3GB at max
* Allocation is slow
  * General purpose allocators like `malloc` are inefficient when you know your data
* Memory needs to tracked and budgeted among subsystems

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Allocators are a science of their own.
To learn more, visit the FMI course or find a book.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Garbage collection (GC)

What if we can pretend we are writing in JavaScript?

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

This is the briefest of briefest descriptions of GC

* GC makes all allocations internally
* User receives a shared-pointer-like structure
* Once in a while, it goes through all allocations and checks if anyone's using them
  * If not, frees the memory
  * If yes, do nothing

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Applications

* Memory management is hard - let designers have it easy
* Perfect for scripting languages ala Blueprints
* Reference counting is a form of GC

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Resources management and IO

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

File access is bad

- it is slow
- it is different on each platform

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### The filesystem is different on each platform

- Windows - case-insensitive
- Posix - case-sensitive
- Mac OS X - depends on how the disk is mounted!

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- *C:* - drive letter is only on Windows
- Consoles and phones have some prefixes for card, dvd, hdd
- Consoles and phones restrict access to the filesystem
- All OSes restrict write access for regular users
  - installing the game in a system folder and logging next to the executable...

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

- Traversing a folder structure is slow
    - *Content/Meshes/Characters/Player/Mario.collada*
      - each slash is a read the directory descriptor, find the entry and repeat
- Having files out in the open is not a good idea
  - easier to take out content
  - easier to cheat by changing content

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

So what are our options?

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Virtual filesystem

- API that behaves like a filesystem, but reads the files from some kind of an
  archive (zip, lzma, ...)
  - no need to worry about slashes, symbols, roots, drives, etc
- can use multiple archives to allow updates and partial installs
  - Original *content-0.pak* content
  - Patch 1.1 contains *content-1.pak*, which can override content in
    *content-0*

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Can have a special structure, orthogonal to the folder structure
  - all the textures for a model can be stored after the model to improves read times

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Can use compression to reduce download and install times
  - copying a single large faster is much faster than a large number of small
    files

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Support streaming
  - install only the vital assets with the game, stream the rest while the
    player is playing

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Asset streaming

- Games have lots of content, even free-to-play
    - bandwidth is not free
    - players do not want to wait
- Download only the game and the content for the first level
- Download everything else, once the player is in the game

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Resource references

- Paths are human-friendly because of hierarchical organization
- Paths are not efficient for computers
  - strings - heap allocations, take up memory, mess up caches

Use string interning everywhere!

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Guess what - Unreal does all of the above!

```cpp
TCHAR* Path = TEXT("/Game/MyDir/MyTexture.MyTexture");
GridTexture = LoadObject<UTexture2D>(NULL, Path, NULL, LOAD_None, NULL);
```

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

#### Asset cooking

The process of converting development content to shipping content

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Development content

- human-friendly - paths, text-based, etc.
- content-creation tools friendly
- models in 3D Studio MAX, Maya, COLLADA formats
- textures in PSD, TIFF

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Shipping content

- hashes for paths
- models as sets of vertices, indices, material ids & texture ids
- textures in GPU compressed formats

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

##### Image formats

- PNG - mostly RGBA_8 - 32 bits per pixel
- JPEG - lossy

Both are expensive to decode at runtime and consume a lot of memory

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- 2s spritesheet animation of a 100px * 100 px

$$
120 \* 100 \* 100 \* 4 = 4800000 = 4.8 MB
$$

- 2s spritesheet animation of a 200px * 200 px

$$
120 \* 200 \* 200 \* 4 = 4 \* 4800000 = 19.2 MB
$$

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

##### GPU texture formats

- Generally lossy formats, but since they are made for GPUs, the lost quality is
  almost invisible
- Each platform has its own:
  - DDS / BC formats for Windows
  - PVRTC for iOS
  - ETC format for OpenGL ES 2.0/3.0 (Android)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Other topics we can't fit in

* Storing resources under source control
* Versioning resources
* Patching resources
* 3D models
* Protecting resources from tampering

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Reflection

Treating code as resources

![Cat in mirror](resources/07.lowlevel/cat_mirror.jpg)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Reflection is any mechanism that allows for code introspection:

* Looking up / iterating a set of classes or class members by name or type
* Instantiating looked up classes
* Invoking looked up functions; reading / writing to fields
* Creating new classes at runtime

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Some languages provide out-of-the-box reflection (C#, Java, Python, JS)
* Reflection is much harder to achieve in C++

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Reflection is great for...

* Serializing data (saving, sending over network)
* Creating editors for data
* Injecting boring code (e.g. validation, logging)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
UCLASS(Config=Game, DefaultConfig)
class SUSI_API USusiSettings : public UObject
{
    /// The color used for drawing text by the plugin
    /// (e.g. in SSusiLoginScreen)
    UPROPERTY(Config, EditAnywhere, Category = Settings)
    FLinearColor TextColor;

    /// The font used for drawing the border around UI by the plugin
    UPROPERTY(Config, EditAnywhere, ClampMin=10.0f, ClampMax=25.0f)
    float DefaultFontSize;
};
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
void DisplayEditorFor(ReflectableObject* obj)
{
    for (Property& property : obj->GetProperties())
    {
        switch (property->GetType())
        {
            case PropertyTypes::Int:
                DisplayIntegerEditor(property.GetPointerToValue());
                break;
            ...

#### The ways of reflection

* [RTTI](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/type_info)
    - Not enough information, extra-overhead, cannot be configured per-class
* Annotated source code
    - Configurable; lots of boilerplate, error-prone

```cpp
BEGIN_REFLECT(Foo)
class Foo
{
    REFLECT_MEMBER(int, Bar)
    int Bar;
};
END_REFLECT(Foo)
```

#### The ways of reflection (cont.)

* Compiler hacking
  - use an external tool parsing debugging info / the AST or
  modify an open-source compiler
  - powerful; kind of platform-dependent, un-configurable

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### The ways of reflection (cont.)

* Custom tool + annotations
  - custom tool looking for certain annotations
  - if found, do magic tricks with the AST to parse the type
  - has all the good things

```cpp
REFLECT_CLASS()
class Foo
{
    REFLECT_PROPERTY()
    int Bar;
};
```

### Configuration

Every engine needs basic configuration

- where is the content?
- graphics quality
  - AA, LODs, FOV, etc
- log level

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Gameplay:

- difficulty level
- most of the gameplay is actually configuration
  - speed of time, character movement
  - cost and effect of actions
    - i.e. cost of highway per km vs the number of cars in a city builder game

Some games are entirely done in configuration files

- Text vs. binary files
- Local vs. cloud storage

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Text files

- *ini* files
  - very simple and quite popular
  - no complex structures
- *json* - not very human friendly
- *xml* - no, just don't
- custom format
  - boost has a library for that
- full scale programming language, i.e. Lua, JavaScript, Scheme
  - keep the amount of logic in the config sane (or no logic at all)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Text files have to be parsed

- slow
- makes allocations

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Binary files

- not human friendly
- asset cooking can convert a text configuration into a binary one
  - use the text configuration to initialize C++ structures and serialize them

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Runtime configuration

- Cheats
  - We all know what ISEEDEADPEOPLE & PANZER do
- Developer menus - can change variables or execute more complex gameplay
  - i.e. craft an item, without having the Crafting interface ready

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Runtime configuration

- Terminal / shell in the game
  - add a REPL powered by a scripting language
- RPC / HTTP rest for remote access
  - typing on a console can be difficult
  - allows remote debugging

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Storing configurations

- Some platforms restrict the amount of data you can save
- Cloud storage - my settings will be preserved, no matter where I play from
  - requires internet
