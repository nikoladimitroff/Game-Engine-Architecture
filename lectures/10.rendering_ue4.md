# Sanity check

We are recording, aren't we?

## Review

What's the difference between these two lines?

```cpp
FModuleManager::UnloadModule(TEXT("Susi"));
FModuleManager::AbandonModule(TEXT("Susi"));
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

What do these things do `FMemory, FMalloc, FPlatformMemory`?

* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> `FMemory` is a high-level class for doing memory stuff
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> `FMalloc` is an interface for UE4's multiple general-purpose allocators
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> `FPlatformMemory` selects what should the global allocator be and has some memory stats

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

What's the final value of these config settings?

Epic cares about rendering the most and that's pretty obvious in the
[docs](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Rendering/Overview/)

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Reminder from time long past

Rendering is usually split in 3 levels:

* The graphics device
* Utilities for rendering common things - cubes, lines, models
* The scene graph

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

UE4 does mostly this:

* *RHI* (Rendering Hardware Interface)
* *RenderCore* - utilities (but for thread management mostly, not for drawing directly!)
* *Renderer* - does mostly everything else

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

Different graphics devices have different APIs
(and capabilities).

Abstracting them is hard and should be minimal.

Enter RHI.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* RHI is the lowest-level rendering module.
* Provides abstractions over the GPU pipeline
* ...which in turn makes it a graphics device API
* `FDynamicRHI` is the interface for graphics devices
* `GDynamicRHI` is its intstance that drives everything

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* RHI simplifies the pipeline
    - The engine manages the graphics device
    - The engine hides shader compilation
    - Functions are generally higher-level than raw devices
* Helper objects are created with the global functions `RHICreateFoo`
    - The returned objects are instances of `FRHIFoo`
* State binding and drawing is done through `FRHICommandList`

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## The command (task) pattern

* Create a functor that holds some state
* Store the functor in a queue of commands
* Execute when deemed neccessary
* Often used for multithreading; undo/redo systems

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
class ICommand
{
    virtual void Execute();
};
...
std::queue<ICommand*> commands;
...
commands.enqueue(new SetStateCommand());
commands.enqueue(new DrawIndexedCommand());
...
// Execute all commands when time comes
while (commands.size())
{
    commands.dequeue()->Execute();
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

The command pattern is used at multiple places
in UE4

`FRHICommandList` enqueues a command for the RHI thread

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
// Object creation
FRHIResourceCreateInfo CreateInfo;
auto Texture = RHICreateTexture2D(SizeX, SizeY, uint8 Format,
    NumMips, NumSamples, Flags,
    FRHIResourceCreateInfo& CreateInfo);

auto BoundShaderState = RHICreateBoundShaderState(VertexDeclaration, VertexShader,
    nullptr, nullptr, PixelShader, nullptr);
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
// State binding and drawing
CmdList->SetBoundShaderState(BoundShaderState);
PixelShader->SetShaderTexture(CmdList, TextureIndex, Texture);
CmdList->DrawIndexedPrimitive(
    IndexBufferRHI,
    EPrimitiveType::PT_TriangleList,
    BaseVertexIndex,
    FirstInstanceIndex,
    IndexCount * 3,
    StartIndex,
    PrimitiveCount,
    InstancesCount);
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Shaders

* Written in HLSL
* The Unreal Shader Compiler transpiles them for the target platform
* Stored in *Engine/Shaders/* in *\*.usf* files (go fiddle with them!)
* Need a CPP equivalent class

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
class FSusiPixelShader : public FGlobalShader
{
    DECLARE_SHADER_TYPE(FSusiPixelShader, Global);
};
..
IMPLEMENT_SHADER_TYPE(template <>, FSusiPixelShader, TEXT("SusiPS"), TEXT("SusiPS"), SF_Pixel);
..
auto GlobalMap = GetGlobalShaderMap(GMaxRHIShaderPlatform, false);
auto SusiShaderPS = *TShaderMapRef<FSusiPixelShader>(GlobalMap);
```

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## RenderCore

Provides several key utilities

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## The rendering thread

* UE4 uses separate rendering and RHI threads
    - the RHI thread executes graphics-device commands
    - the rendering thread enqueues commands for the RHI thread
    by setting up draw calls for meshes
* *RenderCore* manages both. See *RenderingThread.h*

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Enqueing tasks for the rendering thread

```cpp
FKitten* Kitty = SpawnANewKittyLionKingStyle();
ENQUEUE_UNIQUE_RENDER_COMMAND_ONEPARAMETER(RenderKitties,
    FKitten, Simba, Kitty,
    {
        Simba->Render();
    });
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### `FRenderCommandFence`

* Inserts a special-purpose command in the rendering queue
* Enables synchronization between the game and the rendering thread

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
class AMyActor : public AActor
{
    FRenderCommandFence Fence;
};
..
void AMyActor::BeginDestroy()
{
    // Request rendering resources destruction
    Fence.BeginFence();
}
bool AMyActor::IsReadyForFinishDestroy()
{
    return Fence.IsFenceComplete();
}
```

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Renderer architecture

* UE4 objects are not thread-safe!
* The rendering thread has its own set of classes:

| Game thread           | Rendering thread      |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| `UWorld`              | `FScene`              |
| `UPrimitiveComponent` | `FPrimitiveSceneInfo` |
| `ULightComponent`     | `FLightSceneInfo`     |

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
/** FStaticMeshSceneProxy is called on the game thread
    when a UStaticMeshComponent component is registered to the scene. */
FStaticMeshSceneProxy::FStaticMeshSceneProxy(UStaticMeshComponent* InComponent):
    Owner(InComponent->GetOwner()) <======== Note: AActor pointer is cached
    {}
    ...

/** DrawDynamicElements is called on the rendering thread
    when the renderer is doing a pass over the scene. */
void FStaticMeshSceneProxy::DrawDynamicElements(...)
{
    if (Owner->AnyProperty) <========== Race condition!
        // The game thread owns all AActor / UObject state,
        // and may be writing to it at any time.  The UObject
        // may even have been garbage collected, causing a crash.
        // This could have been done safely by mirroring the
        // value of AnyProperty in this proxy.
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
FStaticMeshSceneProxy::FStaticMeshSceneProxy(UStaticMeshComponent* InComponent):
    MyProperty(InComponent->GetOwner()->MyProperty)
    {}
    ...

void FStaticMeshSceneProxy::DrawDynamicElements(...)
{
    // Updates to this value MUST be pushed from the game thread
    // via ENQUEUE_UNIQUE_RENDER_COMMAND
    auto Prop = MyProperty;
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

The rendering thread is always 1 or 2 frames behind.

Synchronization is done at the end of each `Tick()`.

## Deferred rendering

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Rendering paths

* Dynamic path
    - minimal insertion
    - high traversal cost
        - no state sorting
        - no state caching
* Static path
    - static draw lists
    - static sorting and caching
    - 3x faster
    - developer-friendly

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### The high-level path

1. `GSceneRenderTargets.Allocate`
1. `InitViews`
1. PrePass / Depth only pass
1. Base pass
1. Occlusion queries
1. Lighting
1. Fog
1. Translucency
1. Post Processing

Run `profilegpu` in the console for details
