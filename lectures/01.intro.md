# What's this course about?

### The secret holy order of illuminati game developers

(just kidding)

(we'll have to kill you if we tell you about it)

## Game development

* How does a game team look like?
* What do they do?
* How does a commercially-succesful game engine look like?
* Is Unreal Engine 4 *awesome*? (hint: yes, yes it is)

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

# Who should visit the course?

* Pokemons and power rangers.

In their absence, we'll have to fill in the gaps with:
* DEVELOPERS
* DEVELOPERS
* DEVELOPERS

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* We'll focus on the hardcore (and more interesting) side of game development - programming
* We'll explain fancy keywords
* And advanced algorithms / techniques
* We'll only spend some itty-bitty time discussing game design and content creation (they deserve a course of their own!)
* But you'll get to see how awesome UE4 is.
* We'll make it hard to you - homeworks, tests and a course project. Cheaters will be *bannished to the ethereal world.*

# Why do we do it?

* We like torturing people
* We also *kind of* like speaking to other game developers
* We work at Coherent Labs and we greatly value talent
  - Come visit at the next Sofia GameDev Meetup
  - Do well in the course and come work with us

## Shameless advertisement time

* Coherent Labs makes UI middleware<sup>1</sup>
* We let people use HTML5 to build what's otherwise mundane, slow and error-prone
* We are platform-friendly<sup>2</sup> - Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, WP8, iOS, Android, PS4, Xbox One
* We are engine-friendly - deep integrations into UE4 and Unity3D

<p class="left-aligned">
    <sup>1</sup> Awesome UI middleware
    </br>
    <sup>2</sup> Except for Mac which we sincerely fucking hate. Must be bannished to the ethereal world.

# Course structure

* 2 hours of theoretical game engine architecture
* 2 hours of Unreal Engine 4 goodness

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Grading

* Two tests * 15% = 30%
* Two homeworks * 15% = 30%
* Course project * 40% = 40%
* Absence from lectures will not be punished
* Presence in lectures will not be rewarded (grade-wise)
* LIMITTED OFFER, ONLY IN THE NEXT 15 WEEKS - Cheat once,
be banned in the ethereal world until next September!

# Game development is

* ...damn fun
* ...incredibly rewarding
* ...an art form

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* ...incredibly time-consuming ![Prepare Your Posterior](resources/01.intro/prepare_thine_posterior.jpg)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* ...harder than mainstream programming [(ask SpaceX)](http://www.fastcompany.com/3031512/why-spacex-and-other-non-gaming-companies-are-scouting-talent-at-e3)

# A game dev team

* Developers<sup>1</sup>
  - Game
  - Engine
  - Tools
* Designers (Game designers, level designers)
* Artists (Concept Artists, Modelers, Animators, Writers, Composers, Actors)

<sup>1</sup> Can be further specialized into subsystems.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

# What's a game?

* soft realtime
* interactive
* agent-based
* simulation

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

# A game engine

* A game engine is a framework for creating games that provides
common reusable functionality
* Often genre-specific
* Writing a engine from a scratch is a huge effort - don't do it


--- NEXT SLIDE ---

# Game Engine requirements

* Vary between genres
  - compare open-world games vs fighting games

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Performance
  - Frames per second >= 60 --> you only have 16 ms!
  - *Very easy* to mess up
  - *Very hard* to get right

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Graphics
  - Photorealistic Vs. Artistic Vs. Cartoonish Vs. Retro pixelated


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Player input
    - Keyboard & mouse
    - Gamepads and controllers
    - Touch & gestures
    - Motion
    - Handling multiple devices

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Target hardware
    - Desktop platforms
    - Consoles
    - Mobile

# Engine structure

[Click me](resources/01.intro/runtime_arch.jpg)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Hardware, OS, drivers and compilers
    - All platforms have an SDK of their own
    - Different compilers are needed (or better optimized) for specific platforms (i.e. MSVC is better than clang and gcc on Windows)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Third party middleware
    - Standard library
    - Low-level graphics API - DirectX, OpenGl, Metal, GLES
    - Physics simulation - Havok, PhysX, Bullet
    - UI - Coherent *, Scaleform
