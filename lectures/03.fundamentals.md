## Review

What are the 3 main types of programmers in a game team ?

Game, Engine and Tools
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

What are the 3 major phases of a game's creation?

Pre-production, production, post-production
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

Name 3 requirements that drive game engine development

* Matching game needs (specific graphics type, networking model, physics accuracy, etc.) <!-- .element class="fragment" data-index="0" -->
* Specific hardware requirements <!-- .element class="fragment" data-index="0" -->
* Artist & designer friendliness <!-- .element class="fragment" data-index="0" -->
* Cost of using external vs building your own <!-- .element class="fragment" data-index="0" -->

# Fundamentals

1. Basic C++ Review
1. Modern C++
  * `auto`, lambdas, `<algorithm>`
  * smart pointers, delegates
  * error handling
1. Pipelines, Caches and Optimization

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## C++

* Most games are written in C/C++
* Even games that are not written in C++, have C++ at their core
* Or languages that are not C++, but close enough
  * Some studios ([1](https://www.embark-studios.com/), [2](http://www.readyatdawn.com/)) have stated that new code will be [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) exclusive

# Basic C++ Review

...the room becomes silent in 3..2..1...

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

***What are preprocessor, compiler and linker?***

* The preprocessor replaces macros and preprocessor commands (like #include) to produce the final .cpp
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* The compiler converts the final .cpp file into an .obj file.
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* The linker glues all .obj files in an executable or library.
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

***What's a reference?***

A reference is an alias to a variable.
<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

```cpp
int x = 5;
int& y = x;
y = 6;
std::cout << x; // 6
```
<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

***What's a pointer?***

A pointer is an integer that stores the address of the memory cell holding the variable's value.
<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

```cpp
int x = 5;
int* p = &x;
*p = 6;
std::cout << x; // 6
```
<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

![Pointer diagram](resources/03.fundamentals/pointer_tutorial.png)
<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

***What are `const` refs and `const` pointers?***

Ways to access the data by promising not to change it.
<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

```cpp
int x = 5;
const int& y = x;
// y = 6; // error; x isn't const but can't be changed through y
x = 42; // that's fine
std::cout << x; // 42
```
<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

***What are the stack and the heap?***

* A logical separation of the RAM. Stack memory is automatic and static. The heap is manual and dynamic.

<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

![Stack and heap](resources/03.fundamentals/stack_and_heap.png)
<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

***What are `new` and `delete`?***

Keywords for constructing variables, and (almost always) allocating memory for them on heap.
<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

```cpp
int main()
{
    // On the stack; memory is freed when main ends
    int normalInt = 5;
    // On the heap; memory must be freed manually
    int* expensiveInt = new int(5);
    // If you forget the delete, you leak memory
    delete expensiveInt;
}
```
<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

***What are classes and structs?***

Blueprints for creating objects which represents some real world or program-specific concept.
<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

```cpp
// With all the math we need, every engine has some sort of Vector3
struct Vector3
{
    float X;
    float Y;
    float Z;
};
```
<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

***What are the big 3/4/5?***

```cpp
struct Vector3
{
    // A default constructor
    Vector3() : X(0.f), Y(0.f), Z(0.f)
    {}
    // A copy constructor
    Vector3(const Vector3 v) : X(v.X), Y(v.Y), Z(v.Z)
    {}
    // An assignment operator
    Vector3& operator=(const Vector3 v)
    { X = v.x; Y = v.Y; Z = v.Z; }
    // Destructor; this one is empty
    ~Vector3()
    {}
    // Homework: google move semantics
};
```
<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

***What's a template?***

A feature that allows us to reuse the same function
or class for different types
<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

```cpp
template<typename T>
T Sum(T first, T second)
{
    return first + second;
}
...
int integer = Sum(2, 3); // 5
Vector3 vec = Sum(Vector3(1, 0, 0), Vector3(0, 1, 0)); // (1, 1, 0)
```
<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

***What's a `std::vector`?***

A dynamic array; O(1) appending, O(n) random insertion, O(n) search
<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
```cpp
std::vector<int> list = { 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 }; // 6 items
list.push_back(list[4] + list[5]); // add the next Fibonacci
std::cout << list.size(); // 7
std::cout << list[list.size() - 1]; // 21
```
<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

***What's a `std::unordered_map`?***

*Not to be confused with `std::map`*

A hash table; O(1) insert, O(1) search
<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
```cpp
std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string> rulersByCountry =
{
    {"India", "Gandhi"},
    {"Bulgaria", "Simeon the Great"}
};
std::cout << rulersByCountry["Bulgaria"]; // Simeon the Great
```

## Modern C++ (11 / 14 / 17)

The language you didn't learn in your Intro to programming courses

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

DISCLAIMER: The following slides aren't meant to be a complete reference to the material

* You don't need to know all of these to pass the course
* The more you know, the better you will be
* Use Google or suggested books

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Auto

Saves you from writing the variable type. Use with caution.

```cpp
auto num = 5; // this is a int
auto realNum = 5.5; // this is a double
std::vector<double> vec;
auto vecCopy = vec; // this is a std::vector<double>
auto& vecRef = vec; // this is a std::vector<double>&
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Range-based for loop

Loops over the contents of a container without an index

```cpp
std::vector<int> vec = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (const int& value : vec) {
    std::cout << value << ", " ;
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Even cooler in C++17

```cpp
for (auto&& [key, value] : myMap) {
    // use key and value
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### $\lambda$ functions

In-place function. This one doesn't have a capture.

```cpp
const auto isEven = [](int i) { return i % 2 == 0; };
std::cout << isEven(5); // false
std::cout << isEven(4); // true
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

###  $\lambda$ functions

This one captures a variable.

```cpp
std::vector<int> primeNumbers = { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 };
const auto isPrime = [&primeNumbers](int value)
{
    for (const auto& num : primeNumbers)
    {
        if (num == value)
        {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
};
std::cout << isPrime(5); // true
std::cout << isPrime(4); // false
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### *Using* for types

Lets you define new names for long types

```cpp
using EntityList = std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Entity>>;
...
EntityList list;
std::cout << list.size();

// Mostly equivalent to typedef, but better
typedef std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Entity>> EntityList;
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Algorithms

`<algorithm>` is a header of great importance

* Contains a bunch of algorithms usually found in code
* Can save you a lot of time implementing them
* Make code much more readable

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Algorithms

Find some item in a container

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
struct Player
{   const char* Name; const char* Color; };

std::vector<Player> vec =
{
    {"Nikola", "Red"},
    {"Alex", "Blue"},
    {"Viktor", "Green"}
};
auto alex = std::find_if(vec.begin(), vec.end(), [](const Player& p)
{
    return strcmp(p.Name, "Alex") == 0;
});
if (alex != vec.end()) // Did we find it?
    std::cout << "Alex's color is " << alex.Color; // Blue
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Algorithms v2

Sort only the even numbers

```cpp
std::vector<int> numbers = { 42, 3, 5, 6, 0, 99, 10, 101 };

const auto isEven = [](int i) { return i % 2 == 0; };
auto newEnd = std::remove_if(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), isEven);
numbers.erase(newEnd, numbers.end());
std::sort(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());

for (const auto& num : numbers)
    std::cout << num << " "; // 0 6 10 42
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### And a bunch of other things that we aren't explaining

* The rest of `<algorithm>`
* SFINAE
* `<thread>`
* `<chrono>`

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Delegates and Events

An explosive duo

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Delegates

A mechanism for calling one or many functions without knowing which
these functions are in advance. This is known as dynamic dispatching.

Polymorphism in OOP does the same <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Delegates

You've already seen delegates!

```cpp
void PrintPlayer1() { std::cout << "Mario"; }
void PrintPlayer2() { std::cout << "Luigi"; }
...

using PrinterFunction = void (*)();

PrinterFunction p = rand() % 2 ? &PrintPlayer1 : &PrintPlayer2;
p(); // Prints either "Mario" or "Luigi"
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Function pointers are a bit clunky

* Need different types for free functions and member functions
* Can't store structs with `operator()`
* Can't store lambdas

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Enter std::function

```cpp
int CalcFibonacci(int index)
{
    if (index == 0)
        return 1;
    return CalcFibonacci(index - 1) + CalcFibonacci(index - 2);
}
...
std::function<int(int)> computeSeriesMember(CalcFibonacci);
computeSeriesMember(5);
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Function pointers and `std::function` can only store one function - they are **single-cast** delegates.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Multicast delegates

A multicast delegate is a **collection** of functions that can be called as if they were one.

Multicast delegates **cannot** return values (what if the functions disagree?)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Events & callbacks

Executing code when something happens made easy

* Code that triggers the event is called *event source* or *dispatcher*
* Code that waits for the event to happen is called *event listener* or *subscriber*

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
class Button
{
    using OnClickCallback = std::function<void()>;
    std::vector<OnClickCallback> m_Subscribers;

    void Subscribe(OnClickCallback callback)
    {
        m_Subscribers.push_back(callback);
    }

    void Click()
    {
        for (auto& callback : m_Subscribers)
            // Notify all subscribers
            callback();
    }
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
void PrintClicked()
{
    std::cout << "Clicked!";
}
...
Button b;
b.Subscribe(PrintClicked);
```

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Pointer troubles

How do you like this code?

```cpp
void BringWeaponToPlayer(Player* player)
{
    Squire* squire = player->SpawnSquire();
    if (!squire->HasWeapons())
    {
        delete squire;
        return;
    }
    Weapon* weapon = squire->SpawnFirstWeapon();
    if (!player->CanEquip(weapon))
    {
        delete weapon;
        delete squire;
        return;
    }
    player->Equip(weapon);
    delete squire;
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* The `squire` was deleted at 3 different places
* The `weapon` was deleted in just one, but it's unclear if that's fine
* It is easy for someone to mess it up

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## More pointer troubles

What's the relationship between `Player` and its pointers?

```cpp
class Player
{
public:
    Weapon* PrimaryWeapon;
    Quest* RaidMission;
    SteamProfile* Profile;
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

The 3 different pointers express different relationships

* `Player` *owns* the `PrimaryWeapon` - when the player dies, the weapon should too

<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* `Player` *shares* the `RaidMission` - the raid mission object should be destroyed when all raid members are destroyed

<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* `Player` *uses* the `Profile` - their lifetimes are independent

<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

# RAII & Smart pointers

Resource acquisition is initialization

* Whenever you access a resource
  * Acquire in constructor
  * Release in destructor

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

RAII is important because

* Makes responsibility clear <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
  * "Who should delete this?" <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
* Guarantees that the code which got the resource is the same to free it  <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  * Different parts of the code may allocate resources differently  <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Saves you from errors  <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  * Branching code needs multiple calls to delete without RAII  <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Smart pointers are RAII helpers for memory.

Smart pointers are structs designed to act as if they were pointers.

* `operator*()`
* `operator->()`
* `explicit operator bool()`

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### `std::unique_ptr`

C++ 11 introduces `std::unique_ptr`

* Uncopyable
* Moveable
* `std::unique_ptr` owns the resource it is pointing to.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### `std::unique_ptr<T>`

```cpp
class Player
{
public:
    std::unique_ptr<Weapon> PrimaryWeapon;
    Player()
        // Will be deleted in auto generated destructor
        : PrimaryWeapon(new RandomizedSword());
    {
        std::cout << PrimaryWeapon->GetName(); // "Axe of Cats"
    }
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### `std::unique_ptr<T>`

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<char[]> ReadFile(const char* path)
{
    // Sometimes, we need to first allocate memory
    std::unique_ptr<char[]> buffer(new char[GetFileSize(path)]);
    // And then operate on it with no guarantee of success
    const bool didSucceed = TryReadFile(path);
    if (!didSucceed)
    {
        buffer.reset();
        // buffer is now nullptr; memory has been freed
    }
    return buffer;
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### `std::unique_ptr<T>`

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<char[]> buffer = ReadFile("foo.txt");
if (buffer)
{
    std::cout << "First byte is " << buffer[0];
}
```

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Reference counting

* Sometimes a resources is shared between different objects
* Increment a counter on access
* Decrement a counter on release
* When counter reaches 0 - delete

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### `std::shared_ptr<T>`

C++ 11 introduces `std::shared_ptr`

* Copyable
* Moveable
* Ownership of an object is shared among all `std::shared_ptr` pointing to it.
* Create with `std::make_shared<T>`. (Technically, you can create it in other ways, but this is the only one you need to know)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### `std::shared_ptr<T>`

```cpp
class Player
{
    std::shared_ptr<RaidMission> Mission;

    Player(const std::shared_ptr<RaidMission>& mission)
        // Counter will be decremented in the destructor
        : Mission(mission);
    {
        std::cout << Mission->GetName(); // "Destroy 5 towers"
    }
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### `std::shared_ptr<T>`

```cpp
std::shared_ptr<RaidMission> mission =
    std::make_shared<RaidMission>("Destroy towers"); // Counter == 1
{
    Player p1(mission); // Counter == 2
    mission.reset(); // Counter == 1; mission is now nullptr
    {
        Player p2(p1.Mission); // Counter == 2
    } // Counter == 1
} // Counter == 0; object is deleted
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Reference Counting and cycles

If you have a cycle in the references between resources in
`std::shared_ptr`, these resources will never be freed.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Reference Counting and cycles

```cpp
class RaidMission;
class Player
{
    std::shared_ptr<RaidMission> Mission;
    Player(const std::shared_ptr<RaidMission>& mission)
        : Mission(mission) {}
}
class RaidMission
{
    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Player>> Players;
    void AddPlayer(const std::shared_ptr<Player>& p)
    { Players.push_back(p); }
}
...
auto mission = std::make_shared<RaidMission>();
auto player = std::make_shared<Player>(mission);
mission->AddPlayer(player); // ggwp; player is now immortal
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Handling cycles

* manually by breaking the cycle (e.g. call `std::shared_ptr<T>::reset` on either pointer)
* use *weak* references

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## `std::weak_ptr`

*Weak* pointers point to a resource, but do not prolong its lifetime.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
std::weak_ptr<int> w;
{
    std::shared_ptr<int> s = std::make_shared<int>(42); // Counter == 1
    w = s; // Counter still 1
} // Counter == 0; object dies

// Is object alive?
if (std::shared_ptr<int> pointer = w.lock()) {
    std::cout << "Still alive! Value: " << *pointer;
} else {
    std::cout << "It's gone";
}
```

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Error handling

* Error handling in the language
  - C - error codes
  - C++ - exceptions;
  - Anyone willing to explain the difference?
* Error handling in the real world <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
  * error codes are error prone <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
  * exceptions are rebranded gotos <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
  * exceptions are poorly implemented <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Exceptions

~~`goto`~~ exceptions are bad because they jump around unpredictably

```cpp
double MySqrt(double num)
{
    if (num < 0)
        throw std::invalid_argument("received negative value");
    return std::sqrt(num);
}
double DoSomeMath()
{
    double num;
    std::cin >> num;
    MySqrt(num); // What happens if num == -5?

#### Exceptions

* have performance impact even when there no exceptions
  * on Windows function calls become significantly more expensive
  * GCC/CLANG use a static jump table, which makes the executable larger

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Exceptions are frowned upon in many environments
  * forbidden on old generation of consoles (PS3, XB360) - no runtime support
  * off-by-default on Android / iOS (you want your game small!)
  * off-by-default on current and last generation of consoles (PS5/PS4, XBX/XB1)

#### Error handling in the real world

* Logging
* Assertions
* Crash-handling

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

##### Logging

* Having only an error (and may be a callstack) often is not enough
* Games simulate many entities over many frames over many systems
* Logging is essential for understanding what is going on with the program

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Assertions

* Crash if an invariant is broken
* only in `_DEBUG` builds
* default `assert` only gives you callstack, often a custom one is used

```cpp
void UseAbility(Character* character, Ability* ability)
{
    assert(character != nullptr);
    assert(ability != nullptr);
    assert(character->DoesKnowSkill(ability));
    ...
}
```

## Standard library != STL

* Your standard library is the implementation of containers, smart pointers, algorithms, thread management
* STL is *one possible* implementation you can use that comes bundled with your compiler but there are others
* STL has issues

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* poor memory management
* poor portability
* poor control (`std::shared_ptr`)

Note:
* containers allocate when empty
* The standard requires only O-notation for certain operations, all the rest is implementation defined
* small string optimization?
* no control over shared_ptr counter type (8,16,32bit?, thread safe?)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

##### Alternatives

* EASTL - fixes the allocator issues of STL.

* Bitsquid Foundation library
* folly
* STLport

## Performance

...room goes silent in 3..2..1...

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Shortest review of how a computer works

* Processor reads and writes data from RAM
* RAM is slow so let there be caches
* CPU reads from L1 if possible, if not L2, if not L3, if not RAM, if not disk

Cache enemies:

* `std::list`
* `std::map`, `std::set`

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* `std::shared_ptr`
    * one pointer-chase for the counter block
    * another pointer-chase for the actual object (unless intrusive)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* `virtual` functions
    * one pointer-chase for the objects v-table
    * one pointer-chase for the object itself
    * code cache - sorting objects by type

### Optimizations

Shipping games are built with every optimization possible!

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

This leads to subtle, shipping only bugs

* static analysis may detect undefined behaviour
* but there's no guarantee for that - which is why you need logging

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Libraries!

The output of a linker can be:
* an executable (\*.exe, \*.elf, \*.out)
* a static library (\*.lib, \*.a)
* a dynamic library (\*.dll, \*.dylib, \*.so)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Executables

* Contain a bunch of instructions and hardcoded data
* Contain a `int main(int argv, char** argc)` function!
* Different platforms use different formats but they are rather similar

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Libraries

Libraries are great for isolating different systems so they are developed separately. This means we get to

* reuse code among projects
* improve iteration times
* reduce patch sizes

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Static libraries

* Are basically an archive of object files
* The linker does nothing on them but package the archive (no error checking)
* Code is embedded in the executable; no need to package them
* Need to be build with the same compiler & compiler options as application

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Dynamic (shared) libraries

* Are ***identical*** to executables in every aspect other that they
lack `int main()`
* Need to be distributed along the executable
* Reusable amongst applications
* Symbols must be exported / imported
  - A symbol is any class / function / variable
* Can be delay loaded!
* Can be patched

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Static linking

* games are shipped in a single executable, without dynamic
  libraries due to better performance
* dynamic libraries are used to speed up development
